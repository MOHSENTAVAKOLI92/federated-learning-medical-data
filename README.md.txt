# Adaptive Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning for Medical Data

This repository contains the source code developed for the dissertation titled:
"Adaptive Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning for Medical Data."

The project evaluates the performance of four federated learning (FL) algorithms—FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and Adaptive Weighted Aggregation (AWA)—across three real-world medical datasets: PIMA Indian Diabetes, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease Cleveland.
